# Java Servlet

## Steps to run the web page

Requirements -  TOMCAT Server

The above file structure is saved in 
- C:\xampp\tomcat\webapps\folder-name\ (if your using xampp)
- C:\tomcat\webapps\folder-name\

The java file presented in ./WEB-INF/classes/DemoServlet.java is compiled and converted into class file.

(It is very important to set classpath to servlet-api.jar file as program contains classes form those files)

Start the TOMCAT server and the url for the web page will be "http://localhost:8080/folder-name/".

Your Web page will be running successfully.
